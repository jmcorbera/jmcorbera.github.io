## <b> SOA </b>

## Service Oriented Architecture

SOA (Service Oriented architecture) It is a service-oriented architecture paradigm. Defines a way to make software components reusable and interoperable via service interfaces.
The services are exposed using standard network protocols — such as SOAP (simple object access protocol)/HTTP or Restful HTTP (JSON/HTTP) — to send requests to read or change data.

## <b>.Net 5 </b>

## Implementing API Rest

With this implementation, the aim is to generate a structural model for a API REST application using .NET 5. For this, a layered architecture is created and the Repository Pattern is used.

## <b>.Net Framework</b> 

## Implementing WCF SOAP Service

Here we are going to show a basic architecture implementation of a service SOAP with WCF, the tool included in the .NET Framework, to be hosted in IIS/WAS. For this, a layered architecture is created and the Dependency Injection (DI) Pattern is used.
